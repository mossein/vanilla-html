<h2>the last light</h2>

<blockquote>
<i>
The streetlamp flickers twice before settling<br>
into its nightly vigil. I count the seconds<br>
between each pulse of amber light,<br>
wondering if the moths notice<br>
the way I do&mdash;<br>
<br>
this small death and resurrection,<br>
over and over,<br>
until morning comes<br>
to render us all <del>invisible</del> unnecessary.

<blockquote>
<small>
Written at 2am. The streetlamp outside my window has been flickering for weeks. 
I keep meaning to call someone about it, but now I think I'd miss it.

<h2>kitchen table confessional</h2>

<blockquote>
<q>People pray at altars,</q> she said, wiping flour from her hands, <q>but they confess at kitchen tables.</q>
<br><br>
I think about that now, sitting where she used to sit, the wood worn smooth by generations of elbows and forearms, of hands wrapped around warm mugs. The morning light falls the same way it always did.
<br><br>
Some furniture holds memory better than others.

<h2>three small observations</h2>

<blockquote>
<b>i.</b><br>
The spider in the corner of my window has rebuilt her web for the fourth time this week. I admire her persistence, or perhaps her stubbornness. 
<br><br>
<small>(Is there a difference?)</small>
<br><br>

<b>ii.</b><br>
Rain sounds different at 3am. Softer. More honest somehow.
<br><br>

<b>iii.</b><br>
I found an old photograph today. In it, I am laughing at something just outside the frame. I have no memory of this moment, but I trust it happened.
